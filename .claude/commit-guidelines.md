# Commit Message Guidelines

## Rules for Git Commits

1. **Keep it simple and concise** - Write like a human developer, not a robot
2. **Be descriptive enough** - Another dev should understand what changed and why
3. **No AI attribution** - Never add "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
4. **No emojis** - Keep it professional
5. **Format**: Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

## Good Examples

```
Add decline success page for RSVP flow
Fix album image alignment on mobile
Update registry payment options styling
```

## Bad Examples

```
Add decline success page for RSVP flow

🤖 Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## Summary

Write commit messages as if you're a human developer on the team. Simple, clear, and to the point.
